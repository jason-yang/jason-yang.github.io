When I first heard of NextJS, I thought it was too good to be true; A single React-based framework that handled both front and back end coding, including server-side rendering.
I have always treated web UX as a client-side solution, and while the idea of server-side rendering (SSR) sounds great, the implementation still ends up having to disconnect client-side specific logic from the "main" app,
which increases the complexity of the application for two main purposes:

1. Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
2. Initial page load times

SEO improvements sounds great, but in practice isn't too big a deal as Google already scrapes Single Page Application (SPA) pages with it's own URL by loading it in headless Chrome.
It may not be perfect, but in the world of SEO where criteria for ranking is unknown and ever changing, minor differences in how Google views a page isn't going to make or break it's SEO ranking.

Page load times also sounds great, if you were loading a single large application logic payload that caused a long initial page load if the browser did not have the JavaScript (js) file already cached.
This can be mitigated with code splitting and using dynamic imports for page components, which I won't get into here, but suffice to say there are solutions for the initial page load problem without resorting to server-side rendering.

So when I decided to take a look at the latest iteration of NextJS, version 13, I saw that the framework decided to take a leap and depart from it's own SSR solution and adopt
[React Server Components](https://react.dev/blog/2023/03/22/react-labs-what-we-have-been-working-on-march-2023#react-server-components), which is currently still in beta.
